Guards, traps, and a variety of puzzles stand between you and your escape from the mysterious Catacombs to the surface.

Uncover an intriguing plot as you navigate your way through what seems to be an underground prison. You have no recollection of how you arrived in these subterranean tunnels, yet you must venture upwards, evading detection by guards.

Fortunately, you have the aid of a small robot earpiece named c7-x that gives you advice and tips along the way, though you do not where it came from in the first place. You can affect some of the story by choosing different outcomes in the dialogue between yourself and other characters you meet.

As you travel, collect precious diamonds throughout levels to increase your score. Some can be well hidden. It will take all your courage and perseverance to conquer the Catacombs, can you escape?

A network connection is NOT required to play the game.
